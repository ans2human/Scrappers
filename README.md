# Scrappers

Python Scrappers using Scrapy framework. 

All the scrappers have 3 stages -

Stage 1- Collect category links.

Stage 2 - Collect product links from category links

Stage 3 - Collect product metadata using product links.

Outputs are taken in csv format for saving data to Mongodb for which pipeline has been implemented in almost every Scrapper.

Happy pythoning
